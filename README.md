# Description of Project

For this project, we used API keys to gather various sets of data. We used an OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for various cities. Then, we selected 4 cities that would be ideal for our vacation. Using a Google Maps API, we mapped a route to travel to the 4 chosen cities. We also used the Google API to find hotels in the cities we will be staying in.
